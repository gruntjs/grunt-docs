**Be advised Grunt `1.0.0` will no longer support Node.js v0.8.**

We ask you to test this release and [report any issues](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues) you are experiencing.

Update to Grunt 1.0.0 today using:

> npm install grunt@1.0.0 --save-dev

**[Please read the RC1 blog post](https://gruntjs.com/blog/2016-02-11-grunt-1.0.0-rc1-released) for more details about changes to Grunt with version 1.0.**

## Peer Dependencies
If you have a Grunt plugin that includes `grunt` in the `peerDependencies` section of your `package.json`, we recommend tagging with `"grunt": ">=0.4.0"`.
Otherwise for npm@2 users `grunt@1.0.0` will receive a hard error when trying to install your plugin and npm@3 users will get a warning.
We have sent over two thousand pull requests to existing plugins to make this change.

**We ask you to send pull requests to your favourite plugins and ask them to update the `peerDependencies` section of their `package.json`.**

## Changes in 1.0.0

* Prevent async callback from being called multiple times. Pull #1464.
* Update copyright to jQuery Foundation and remove redundant headers. Fixes #1478.
* Update glob to 7.0.x. Fixes #1467.
* Removing duplicate BOM strip code. Pull #1482.
* Updated to latest cli ~1.2.0
* Ensure a grunt bin gets created upon install.

### Changes in RC1

* `coffee-script` is upgraded to `~1.10.0` which could incur breaking changes
  when using the language with plugins and Gruntfiles.
* `nopt` is upgraded to `~3.0.6` which has fixed many issues, including passing
  multiple arguments and dealing with numbers as options. Be aware previously
  `--foo bar` used to pass the value `'bar'` to the option `foo`. It will now
  set the option `foo` to `true` and run the task `bar`.
* `glob` is upgraded to `~6.0.4` and `minimatch` is upgraded to `~3.0.0`. Results
  are now sorted by default with `grunt.file.expandMapping()`. Pass the
  `nosort: true` option if you don't want the results to be sorted.
* `lodash` was upgraded to `~4.3.0`. Many changes have occurred. Some of which
  that directly effect Grunt are `grunt.util._.template()` returns a compile
  function and `grunt.util._.flatten` no longer flattens deeply.
  `grunt.util._` is deprecated and we highly encourage you to
  `npm install lodash` and `var _ = require('lodash')` to use `lodash`.
  Please see the lodash changelog for a full list of changes: <https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog>
* `iconv-lite` is upgraded to `~0.4.13` and strips the BOM by default.
* `js-yaml` is upgraded to `~3.5.2` and may affect `grunt.file.readYAML`.
  We encourage you to please `npm install js-yaml` and use
  `var YAML = require('js-yaml')` directly in case of future deprecations.
* A file `mode` option can be passed into
  [grunt.file.write()](https://gruntjs.com/api/grunt.file#grunt.file.write).
* `Done, without errors.` was changed to `Done.` to avoid failing by mistake on the word `errors`.

As we mentioned before, we are also looking for contributors to all [Grunt repositories](https://github.com/gruntjs/) and are willing to mentor you to get more experience with open source.
