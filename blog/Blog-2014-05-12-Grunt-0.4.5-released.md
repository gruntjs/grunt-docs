Grunt 0.4.5 is now available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt).

Thanks to [Gary Burgess](https://github.com/garyb), [James Smith](https://github.com/jmeas) and [Carlos Mantilla](https://github.com/ceoaliongroo) for their patches. Also, thanks to [Vlad Filippov](https://github.com/vladikoff) for helping triage issues, troubleshooting Windows CI testing and putting together the changelog.

In this release, we closed around a dozen issues, added the much-requested [grunt.task.exists](https://gruntjs.com/api/grunt.task#grunt.task.exists) and [grunt.config.merge](https://gruntjs.com/api/grunt.config#grunt.config.merge) methods, and set up Windows CI testing through [AppVeyor](http://www.appveyor.com/). Additionally, the logging API has been broken out into a separate module, [grunt-legacy-log](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-legacy-log), in order to facilitate maintenance.

For a full list of changes, see the [0.4.5 changelog](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/v0.4.5/CHANGELOG).

Additionally, we have accepted a number of patches for [Grunt contrib plugins](https://gruntjs.com/plugins/contrib) and would like to thank [Kevin Mårtensson](https://github.com/kevva), [Alexander Futekov](https://github.com/futekov), [Shinnosuke Watanabe](https://github.com/shinnn), [Shane Daniel](https://github.com/simshanith), [Artem Sapegin](https://github.com/sapegin), [Christoph Pojer](https://github.com/cpojer), [Zhang Yichao](https://github.com/echaozh), [Jevon Wright](https://github.com/soundasleep), [Jacob Lauritzen](https://github.com/Jacse), [XhmikosR](https://github.com/XhmikosR) and [Edan Schwartz](https://github.com/eschwartz) for their contributions.
