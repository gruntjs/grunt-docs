Grunt 0.4.3 is now available on [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt).

This is mostly a bugfix release. Thanks to [Jonathan Krause](https://github.com/jonykrause),
[PatrickJS](https://github.com/gdi2290), [Jason Cust](https://github.com/GlobalDomestic),
[Fabio Crisci](https://github.com/piuccio), [James M. Greene](https://github.com/JamesMGreene)
and [Mike Pennisi](https://github.com/jugglinmike) for their pull requests.

In addition to closing over 30 issues, we have extracted `grunt.util` into 
[its own module](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-legacy-util).  As mentioned
in the [0.4.2](http://gruntjs.com/blog/2013-11-21-grunt-0.4.2-released) release,
we are in process of deprecating the `grunt.util.*` API.  Task developers who use
these APIs should update their plugins to use the libraries recommended in
the [grunt-legacy-util](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-legacy-util) README. 
You may use `grunt-legacy-util` directly as a stopgap, but we will no longer be supporting it.

For a full list of changes, see the 0.4.3 changelog [here](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/v0.4.3/CHANGELOG).

**Happy Grunting!**
