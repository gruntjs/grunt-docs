Grunt 0.4.1 is now available from [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt).

This patch release fixes a number of minor issues that cropped up with the recent release of [Node.js v0.10.0](http://blog.nodejs.org/2013/03/11/node-v0-10-0-stable/), most notably due to changes in the [path](http://nodejs.org/api/path.html) API. If you want to use the latest version of Node.js in your projects, you should probably update Grunt to `~0.4.1` in the [package.json](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#package.json) file for those projects.

Either way, Grunt still works with Node.js v0.8.x, so you don't *need* to update if you haven't upgraded to Node.js v0.10.0.

In addition to the Node.js v0.10.0 changes, we used this opportunity to fix a number of other small issues, like properly handling multibyte I/O when spawning child processes and ensuring the [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#the-gruntfile) name is case-insensitive. For a complete list of changes, see the [v0.4.0 - v0.4.1 changelog](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1).
