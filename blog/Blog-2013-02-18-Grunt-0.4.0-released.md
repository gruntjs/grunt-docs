As of this morning, Grunt v0.4 final is available on npm!  For a lengthy writeup on the release, please see [@tkellen's](http://goingslowly.com) article [on the Bocoup blog](http://weblog.bocoup.com/tearing-grunt-apart/).

### The Biggest Stuff

1. Grunt no longer ships with built in tasks.  They've been extracted into officially maintained, standalone plugins under the grunt-contrib namespace.  See the [plugin listing](http://gruntjs.com/plugins) on our website for more details. 

2. Grunt no longer ships with a binary. In order to get the `grunt` command, install [grunt-cli](http://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) globally with `npm install -g grunt-cli`. This package will run any version of Grunt (including 0.3x) after it's been installed locally to your project.

### The Future

Grunt v0.5 will ship with support for a new plugin format called [node-task](http://github.com/tkellen/node-task). It defines a stateless, promise-based, event emitting API that doesn't depend on Grunt. It has a real-live spec, and the Grunt team is working with the front-end developer community in the hopes that compliant modules will be compatible with every task runner under the sun.
