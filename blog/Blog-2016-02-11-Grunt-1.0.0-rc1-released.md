**The Grunt team is pleased to announce the first release candidate for `1.0.0`.**

This release is made possible by [@shama](https://github.com/shama), [@vladikoff](https://github.com/vladikoff), [@jkaussieskater](https://github.com/jkaussieskater). With support from the jQuery foundation, in particular [@dmethvin](https://github.com/dmethvin) and [@aulvi](https://github.com/aulvi).

Also thanks to contributions by [@XhmikosR](https://github.com/XhmikosR), [@paladox](https://github.com/paladox), [@FredyC](https://github.com/FredyC), [@sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus), [@mrjoelkemp](https://github.com/mrjoelkemp) and more.

This release focuses on fixing critical issues and improved support with Node.js
v0.10, v0.12, v4.0, v5.0 and io.js on Windows, OSX and Linux. We ask you to test the `rc1` and [report any issues](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues) you are experiencing.

> npm install grunt@1.0.0-rc1 --save-dev

Be advised Grunt `1.0.0` will no longer support Node.js v0.8.

## Peer Dependencies
If you have a Grunt plugin that includes `grunt` in the `peerDependencies` section of your `package.json`, we recommend tagging with `"grunt": ">=0.4.0"`. Otherwise when `grunt@1.0.0` is released, npm@2 users will receive a hard error when trying to install your plugin and npm@3 users will get a warning.

Be aware, peer dependencies are no longer installed for users as of npm@3. Users of Grunt plugins are expected to `npm install grunt --save-dev` alongside any Grunt plugin install.

**We ask you to send pull requests to your favourite plugins and ask them to update the `peerDependencies` section of their `package.json`.**

## Request For Comments
We have created an [new repo](https://github.com/gruntjs/rfcs) to encourage
members of the community interested in shaping the future of Grunt to submit a
RFC.

Submitting an RFC will allow you to formally propose a significant change to
Grunt and elicit feedback from the core team and community.

The active proposals will help portray the future roadmap for Grunt and hopefully
expedite community contributions into future Grunt releases.

## npm scripts
We now install `grunt-cli` as part of `grunt`. Many users do not wish to perform
the extra step of `npm install grunt-cli -g`. To better conform to the idioms
of Node.js, you can now `npm install grunt --save-dev` then include Grunt in your
npm scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "grunt": "grunt"
  }
}
```

Your users now only have to `npm install` and `npm run grunt` to run your
`Gruntfile.js`.

Users on `npm >= 2.0.0` can also pass tasks and options with:
`npm run grunt -- task --option=foo` which is equivalent to
`grunt task --option=foo`.

If you would like the `grunt` command on your computer, please continue to
`npm install grunt-cli -g` and use as before.

## API Changes
Be aware, some APIs have changed warranting a major version update:

* `coffee-script` is upgraded to `~1.10.0` which could incur breaking changes
  when using the language with plugins and Gruntfiles.
* `nopt` is upgraded to `~3.0.6` which has fixed many issues, including passing
  multiple arguments and dealing with numbers as options. Be aware previously
  `--foo bar` used to pass the value `'bar'` to the option `foo`. It will now
  set the option `foo` to `true` and run the task `bar`.
* `glob` is upgraded to `~6.0.4` and `minimatch` is upgraded to `~3.0.0`. Results
  are now sorted by default with `grunt.file.expandMapping()`. Pass the
  `nosort: true` option if you don't want the results to be sorted.
* `lodash` was upgraded to `~4.3.0`. Many changes have occurred. Some of which
  that directly effect Grunt are `grunt.util._.template()` returns a compile
  function and `grunt.util._.flatten` no longer flattens deeply.
  `grunt.util._` is deprecated and we highly encourage you to
  `npm install lodash` and `var _ = require('lodash')` to use `lodash`.
  Please see the lodash changelog for a full list of changes: https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog
* `iconv-lite` is upgraded to `~0.4.13` and strips the BOM by default.
* `js-yaml` is upgraded to `~3.5.2` and may affect `grunt.file.readYAML`.
  We encourage you to please `npm install js-yaml` and use
  `var YAML = require('js-yaml')` directly in case of future deprecations.
* A file `mode` option can be passed into
  [grunt.file.write()](http://gruntjs.com/api/grunt.file#grunt.file.write).
* `Done, without errors.` was changed to `Done.` to avoid failing by mistake on the word `errors`.

We encourage you to try out this release.

We are also looking for contributors to all [Grunt repositories](https://github.com/gruntjs/) and are willing to mentor you to get more experience with open source.
