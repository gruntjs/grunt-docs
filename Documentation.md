Welcome to the Grunt documentation page. Here you can find helpful resources, links, and information to start using Grunt. The first step to perform to use the tool is [to install it](https://gruntjs.com/installing-grunt) on your machine.

## Getting started

If you're new to Grunt's world, we suggest to learn more about our CLI and what actions you need to complete to use Grunt in your project. The best resource for that is our [Getting started guide](https://gruntjs.com/getting-started). If you already know what Grunt is and how it works, the next step is to familiarize yourself with [the creation of a `Gruntfile`](https://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks). A `Gruntfile` contains the configuration of the tasks you wish to employ. If you are curious to know how it looks like, you can check out [our sample](https://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile).

## Advanced

Once mastered all the basic concepts you might want to create your own Grunt tasks. Our [step-by-step guide](https://gruntjs.com/creating-plugins) and [the API documentation page](https://gruntjs.com/api/grunt) will help you in achieving this goal.

Grunt helps you ship better projects by automating many tasks. If you feel grateful and want to give something back, the project is always on the outlook for new contributors. To see how you can help, take a look at the [Contributing page](https://gruntjs.com/contributing).

## Help and support

Do you feel lost? We got you covered. Our dedicated [F.A.Q. page](https://gruntjs.com/frequently-asked-questions) should give the answers you need. If you can't find what you're looking for, you can search for more support in our [Help Resources page](https://gruntjs.com/help-resources). In addition, our community will try to assist you in our [#grunt channel on irc.freenode.net](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=grunt).
