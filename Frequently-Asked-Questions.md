## How do I install grunt?
For general installation instructions, please read the [[Getting Started]] guide. If you need more specific information after having read that, read the comprehensive [[Installing grunt]] guide.

## When will I be able to use in-development feature 'X'?
Installing both published and unpublished development versions of Grunt is covered in the [[Installing grunt]] guide.

## Does Grunt work on Windows?
Grunt works fine on Windows, because [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/) both work fine on Windows. Usually the problematic part is [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/), because it bundles an outdated version of Node.js.

The best way to avoid this issue is to use the [msysGit installer](http://msysgit.github.com/) to install the `git` binary and the [Node.js installer](http://nodejs.org/#download) to install the `node` and `npm` binaries, and to use the built-in [Windows command prompt](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr05/cos126/cmd-prompt.html) or [PowerShell](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968929) instead of Cygwin.

## Why doesn't my asynchronous task complete?
Chances are this is happening because you have forgotten to call the [this.async](grunt.task#wiki-this-async) method to tell Grunt that your task is asynchronous. For simplicity's sake, Grunt uses a synchronous coding style, which can be switched to asynchronous by calling `this.async()` within the task body.

Note that passing `false` to the `done()` function tells Grunt that the task has failed.

For example:

```javascript
grunt.registerTask('asyncme', 'My asynchronous task.', function() {
  var done = this.async();
  doSomethingAsync(done);
});
```

## How do I enable shell tab auto-completion?
To enable bash tab auto-completion for grunt, add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
eval "$(grunt --completion=bash)"
```

This assumes that Grunt has been installed globally with `npm install -g grunt`. Currently, the only supported shell is bash.

## How can I share parameters across multiple tasks?
While each task can accept its own parameters, there are a few options available for sharing parameters across multiple tasks.

### "Dynamic" alias tasks
**This is the preferred method for sharing parameters across multiple tasks.**

Whereas [alias tasks](grunt#wiki-grunt-registerTask) are necessarily simple, a regular task can use [grunt.task.run](grunt.task#wiki-grunt-task-run) to make it effectively function as a "dynamic" alias task. In this example, running `grunt build:001` on the command line would result in the `foo:001`, `bar:001` and `baz:001` tasks being run.

```javascript
grunt.registerTask('build', 'Run all my build tasks.', function(n) {
  if (n == null) {
    grunt.warn('Build num must be specified, like build:001.');
  }
  grunt.task.run('foo:' + n, 'bar:' + n, 'baz:' + n);
});
```

### -- options

Another way to share a parameter across multiple tasks would be to use [grunt.option](grunt#wiki-grunt-option). In this example, running `grunt deploy --target=staging` on the command line would cause `grunt.option('target')` to return `"staging"`.

```javascript
grunt.registerTask('upload', 'Upload code to specified target.', function(n) {
  var target = grunt.option('target');
  // do something useful with target here
});
grunt.registerTask('deploy', ['validate', 'upload']);
```

_Note that boolean options can be specified using just a key without a value. For example, running `grunt deploy --staging` on the command line would cause `grunt.option('staging')` to return `true`._

### Globals and configs

In other cases, you may want to expose a way to set configuration or global values. In those cases, register a task that sets its arguments as a global or config value.

In this example, running `grunt set_global:name:peter set_config:target:staging deploy` on the command line would cause `global.name` to be `"peter"` and `grunt.config('target')` to return `"staging"`. Presumably, the `deploy` task would use those values.

```javascript
grunt.registerTask('set_global', 'Set a global variable.', function(name, val) {
  global[name] = val;
});

grunt.registerTask('set_config', 'Set a config property.', function(name, val) {
  grunt.config.set(name, val);
});
```

## How I get a stack trace when an error occurs?

Use the `--stack` option to see stack traces. Such as `grunt task --stack`

## Why am I getting a "Maximum call stack size exceeded" error?

You probably created an alias task with the same name as one of your regular tasks. 
Example: `grunt.registerTask('uglify', ['uglify:my_target']);` should be `grunt.registerTask('myUglify', ['uglify:my_target']);`.

## How do I uninstall or remove unwanted plugins?

At least two ways. One way is to use `npm uninstall [GRUNT_PLUGIN] --save-dev`, this will remove the plugin from your `package.json` and from `node_modules`. You may also delete the dependencies you don't want from your `package.json` manually and then run `npm prune`.

## Error "Fail to install with npm error: No compatible version found"

Make sure you have the latest stable version of [NPM and Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/)

## grunt 0.3 Questions

## On Windows with Grunt 0.3, why does my JS editor open when I try to run grunt?
If you're in the same directory as the [Gruntfile](Getting-started), Windows tries to execute _that file_ when you type grunt. So you need to type `grunt.cmd` instead.

An alternative would be to use the `DOSKEY` command to create a Grunt macro, following [these directions](https://gist.github.com/vladikoff/38307908088d58af206b). That would allow you to use `grunt` instead of `grunt.cmd`.

This is the `DOSKEY` command you'd use:

```
DOSKEY grunt=grunt.cmd $*
```
