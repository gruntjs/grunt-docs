It’s far too easy to create a gist or one-file repository and promise yourself that you’ll add linting and unit tests later. 

Doing all this stuff manually is a total pain, as is building everything into a gigantic Makefile / Jakefile / Cakefile / Rakefile / ?akefile that's maintained across numerous projects. 

With grunt, all the excuses you've ever made just disappear. Instead of being a chore, creating a new project and performing repetitive but necessary tasks such as linting, unit testing, concatenating and minifying files become trivially easy.
