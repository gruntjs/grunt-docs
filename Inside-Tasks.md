While a task is running, Grunt exposes many task-specific utility properties and methods inside the task function via the `this` object. This same object is also exposed as `grunt.task.current` for use in [templates](grunt.template), eg. the property `this.name` is also available as `grunt.task.current.name`.

## Inside All Tasks

### this.async
If a task is asynchronous, this method must be invoked to instruct Grunt to wait. It returns a handle to a "done" function that should be called when the task has completed. Either `false` or an `Error` object may be passed to the done function to instruct Grunt that the task has failed.

If the `this.async` method isn't invoked, the task will execute synchronously.

```javascript
// Tell Grunt this task is asynchronous.
var done = this.async();
// Your async code.
setTimeout(function() {
  // Let's simulate an error, sometimes.
  var success = Math.random() > 0.5;
  // All done!
  done(success);
}, 1000);
```

### this.requires
If one task depends on the successful completion of another task (or tasks), this method can be used to force Grunt to abort if the other task didn't run, or if the other task failed. The tasks list can be an array of task names or individual task names, as arguments.

Note that this won't actually run the specified task(s), it will just fail the current task if they haven't already run successfully.

```javascript
this.requires(tasksList)
```

### this.requiresConfig
Fail the current task if one or more required [config](grunt.config) properties is missing. One or more string or array config properties may be specified.

```javascript
this.requiresConfig(prop [, prop [, ...]])
```

See the [grunt.config documentation](grunt.config) for more information about config properties.

_This method is an alias for the [grunt.config.requires](grunt.config#grunt.config.requires) method._

### this.name
The name of the task, as defined in `grunt.registerTask`. For example, if a "sample" task was run as `grunt sample` or `grunt sample:foo`, inside the task function, `this.name` would be `"sample"`.

_Note that if a task has been renamed with [grunt.task.renameTask](grunt.task#grunt.task.renameTask) this property will reflect the new name._


### this.nameArgs
The name of the task, including any colon-separated arguments or flags specified on the command-line. For example, if a "sample" task was run as `grunt sample:foo`, inside the task function, `this.nameArgs` would be `"sample:foo"`.

_Note that if a task has been renamed with [grunt.task.renameTask](grunt.task#grunt.task.renameTask) this property will reflect the new name._

### this.args
An array of arguments passed to the task. For example, if a "sample" task was run as `grunt sample:foo:bar`, inside the task function, `this.args` would be `["foo", "bar"]`.

_Note that in multi tasks, the current target is omitted from the `this.args` array._

### this.flags
An object generated from the arguments passed to the task. For example, if a "sample" task was run as `grunt sample:foo:bar`, inside the task function, `this.flags` would be `{foo: true, bar: true}`.

_Note that inside multi tasks, the target name is **not** set as a flag._

### this.errorCount
The number of [grunt.log.error](grunt.log#grunt.log.error) calls that occurred during this task. This can be used to fail a task if errors were logged during the task.

### this.options
Returns an options object. Properties of the optional `defaultsObj` argument will be overridden by any task-level `options` object properties, which will be further overridden in multi tasks by any target-level `options` object properties.

```js
this.options([defaultsObj])
```

This example shows how a task might use the `this.options` method:

```js
var options = this.options({
  enabled: false,
});

doSomething(options.enabled);
```

The [Configuring tasks](configuring-tasks#options) guide shows an example of how options may be specified, from the task user's point of view.

## Inside Multi Tasks

### this.target
In a multi task, this property contains the name of the target currently being iterated over. For example, if a "sample" multi task was run as `grunt sample:foo` with the config data `{sample: {foo: "bar"}}`, inside the task function, `this.target` would be `"foo"`.

### this.files
In a multi task, all files specified using any Grunt-supported [file formats and options](configuring-tasks#files), [globbing patterns](configuring-tasks#globbing-patterns) or [dynamic mappings](configuring-tasks#building-the-files-object-dynamically) will automatically be normalized into a single format: the [Files Array file format](configuring-tasks#files-array-format).

What this means is that tasks don't need to contain a ton of boilerplate for explicitly handling custom file formats, globbing patterns, mapping source files to destination files or filtering out files or directories. _A task user can just specify files per the [Configuring tasks](configuring-tasks#files) guide, and **Grunt will handle all the details.**_

Your task should iterate over the `this.files` array, utilizing the `src` and `dest` properties of each object in that array. The `this.files` property will always be an array. The `src` property will also always be an array, in case your task cares about multiple source files per destination file.

_Note that it's possible that nonexistent files might be included in `src` values, so you may want to explicitly test that source files exist before using them._

This example shows how a simple "concat" task might use the `this.files` property:

```js
this.files.forEach(function(file) {
  var contents = file.src.filter(function(filepath) {
    // Remove nonexistent files (it's up to you to filter or warn here).
    if (!grunt.file.exists(filepath)) {
      grunt.log.warn('Source file "' + filepath + '" not found.');
      return false;
    } else {
      return true;
    }
  }).map(function(filepath) {
    // Read and return the file's source.
    return grunt.file.read(filepath);
  }).join('\n');
  // Write joined contents to destination filepath.
  grunt.file.write(file.dest, contents);
  // Print a success message.
  grunt.log.writeln('File "' + file.dest + '" created.');
});
```

_If you need the original file object properties, they are available on each individual file object under the `orig` property, but there is no known use-case for accessing the original properties._

### this.filesSrc
In a multi task, all `src` files specified via any [file format](configuring-tasks#files) are reduced to a single array. If your task is "read only" and doesn't care about destination filepaths, use this array instead of `this.files`.

This example shows how a simple "lint" task might use the `this.filesSrc` property:

```js
// Lint specified files.
var files = this.filesSrc;
var errorCount = 0;
files.forEach(function(filepath) {
  if (!lint(grunt.file.read(filepath))) {
    errorCount++;
  }
});

// Fail task if errors were logged.
if (errorCount > 0) { return false; }

// Otherwise, print a success message.
grunt.log.ok('Files lint free: ' + files.length);
```

### this.data
In a multi task, this is the actual data stored in the Grunt config object for the given target.
For example, if a "sample" multi task was run as `grunt sample:foo` with the config data `{sample: {foo: "bar"}}`, inside the task function, `this.data` would be `"bar"`.

_It is recommended that `this.options` `this.files` and `this.filesSrc` are used instead of `this.data`, as their values are normalized._
